It consists of key components like the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and buses that transfer data between them. While this architecture has been foundational to modern computing, it suffers from the Von Neumann bottleneck, where the CPU and memory share the same data path, limiting the systemâ€™s speed. This bottleneck results in delays as the CPU waits for data or instructions to travel back and forth from memory. Overcoming this limitation is essential for improving computer performance, especially with the rise of faster processors and multitasking systems."

High-level languages, like Python and Java, are more abstract and easier to read, allowing faster development but sacrificing some control and efficiency. You would use a low-level language when performance and memory management are critical, such as in embedded systems or operating system development. High-level languages are ideal for rapid application development, scripting, or when ease of use and readability are priorities."

For images, computers turn pictures into pixel data, where each pixel is just a number representing a color, like red, green, or blue. This helps when analyzing images or using models like neural networks, which look for patterns in the pixels rather than focusing on every single one. By simplifying images this way, computers can better recognize objects or make predictions from the patterns they find."
