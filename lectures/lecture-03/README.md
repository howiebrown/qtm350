# Lecture 03 - Command Line

This folder includes the slides for the third lecture of the course, in which we talk about the command line. The slides are available in `html` format and can be viewed at <https://raw.githack.com/danilofreire/qtm350/main/lectures/lecture-03/03-command-line.html>.

Many thanks to [David Moreira](https://davi-moreira.github.io) and [Simon Munzert](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21/lectures/tree/main) for sharing their materials, which I used as a basis for this lecture.
